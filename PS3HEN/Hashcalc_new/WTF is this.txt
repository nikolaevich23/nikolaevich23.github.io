This is a tool that allows you to calculate the 64 bits hashes used in modulespatch.h (the hash itself is a legacy from psjailbreak).
It is usually the hash of the first section what you will want in most cases.

"unself2" from fail0verflow tools needs to be on the path. And you need the keys, of course.
